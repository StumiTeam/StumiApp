## Description of App:

Stumi (Study with Me) is an app designed to help students stay productive when they study.

### Story


### A Simple Rundown of How Stumi Works:
1. Users set a timer (and subject) for themselves to study
2. When the timer stops, users are granted rewards
    a. if users stop before their goal (i.e. users clear app running in the background or stop the timer in anyway)-> 1 coin/minute
    b. if users reach their goal -> 1.25 coins/minute
3. Rewards can be used to obtain in-app merchandise (decorations, expansions, etc.) for their library

### Stumi Currency/Specifics
    - Coins
        - Obtaining:
            - User generates coins as the timer runs
            - Watch ads (for either a set number of coins or {1.5} coin rate booster)
            - (M) In-app purchases
        - Uses:
            - Purchase furniture, decorations, and library expansions
            - (M) Give scholarships to animals that will join the library
        
    - Books
        - Obtaining: 
            - Each animal in the library generates books as the timer runs (amount generated per hour depends on the animal's level)
        - Uses:
            - Level up animals
            
    - Prestige/EXP
        - Obtaining: 
            - Based on the number of students in and graduates from the school (Every time animals level up or enroll, users get prestige)
        - Uses:
            - Cool profile in the top left corner
            - The chance of animals needing scholarships (along with the amount) decreases as prestige increases
            
    - Regions
        - Obtaining:
            - As users level up, they unlock new regions (Level 1, 5, 10, 15)
        - Uses:
            - Each region has different animals:
            - Level 1 Region: 100% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 5 Region: 75% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 10 Region: 50% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 15 Region: 25% chance of needing a scholarship
            - (M) Level 20 Region: 10% of needing a scholarship
    
### Searching for Animals:
    1. Navigate to the Search Menu
    2. Select the desired region (only ones that are unlocked will be available)
    3. Click "Search"
    4. App System randomly selects an animal and decides on a scholarship amount and chance (ex: $100 scholarship, 50% chance of animal needing scholarship)
    5. User can accept the animal (and give it the scholarship it needs) or turn down the animal
    (M) NOTE: The same species of animal may be found more than once
