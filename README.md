NOTE: Anything with an (M) means TBD

## Description of App:

Stumi (Study You and Me) is an app designed to help students stay productive when they study. By integrating studying and an asethetically pleasing game, we hope that Stumi makes studying more rewarding.

### Story
Stumi-Land is a world like Earth, except it doesn't have any highly intelligent lifeforms like humans. The various species of animals there know how to walk on two legs, but they don't seem to possess understanding of the environment around them. In an effort to teach these animals and hopefully build an intergalactical alliance with them, you build a library and fill it with books of various types, encouraging the animals to learn more.


### A Simple Rundown of How Stumi Works:
1. Users set a timer (and subject) for themselves to study
2. When the timer stops, users are granted rewards
    a. if users stop before their goal (i.e. users clear app running in the background or stop the timer in anyway)-> 1 coin/minute
    b. if users reach their goal -> 1.25 coins/minute
3. Rewards can be used to obtain in-app merchandise (decorations, expansions, etc.) for their library

### Stumi Currency/Specifics
    - Coins
        - Obtaining:
            - User generates coins as the timer runs
            - Watch ads (for either a set number of coins or {1.5} coin rate booster)
            - (M) In-app purchases
        - Uses:
            - Purchase furniture, decorations, and library expansions
            - (M) Give scholarships to animals that will join the library
        
    - Books
        - Obtaining: 
            - Each animal in the library generates books as the timer runs (amount generated per hour depends on the animal's level)
        - Uses:
            - Level up animals
            
    - Prestige/EXP
        - Obtaining: 
            - Based on the number of students in and graduates from the school (Every time animals level up or enroll, users get prestige)
        - Uses:
            - Cool profile in the top left corner
            - The chance of animals needing scholarships (along with the amount) decreases as prestige increases
            
    - Regions
        - Obtaining:
            - As users level up, they unlock new regions (Level 1, 5, 10, 15)
        - Uses:
            - Each region has different animals:
            - Level 1 Region: 100% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 5 Region: 75% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 10 Region: 50% chance of needing a scholarship
            - Level 15 Region: 25% chance of needing a scholarship
            - (M) Level 20 Region: 10% of needing a scholarship
    
### Searching for Animals:
    1. Navigate to the Search Menu
    2. Select the desired region (only ones that are unlocked will be available)
    3. Click "Search"
    4. App System randomly selects an animal and decides on a scholarship amount and chance (ex: $100 scholarship, 50% chance of animal needing scholarship)
    5. User can accept the animal (and give it the scholarship it needs) or turn down the animal
    (M) NOTE: The same species of animal may be found more than once
    
### Stages of animal growth: (Each animal will generate a profession at random sometime throughout their education)
    1. Elementary
    2. Middle/Junior High
    3. High
    4. College/University
    5. Graduated (Alums might offer their services from time to time)
        - Donations (will depnd on number of alums, their various incomes, and number of alums)
        - Alumi Mentoring Program (boosts the book production rate of ALL animals in the library)
        - One-on-One Study Session (significantly boosts book production rate of ONE animal in the library)

## Potential Plans for Future:
    - Create website or desktop application
    - Expand the world map (add more regions)
    - In-app purchases/ads
